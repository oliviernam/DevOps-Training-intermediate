## Lab Objective

The Cloud One Container Control Lab will provide you some ideas and the foundation to explain and demo Container Control. You're going to integrate the service into a kubernetes cluster and explore it.

If you need a cluster, you can create a fresh one within GCP. The provided script `rapid-gke.sh` located within the cloud-gcp folder does that from scratch withing some minutes.
