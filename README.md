## Before you start

### 1. Clone the DevOps Training Material

Do this by starting a terminal (I do prefer iTerm2 :-)), change to your usual develop folder (which you hopefully have) and do a

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mawinkler/devops-training.git
cd devops-training
```

### 2. (Optional) Create your Multi Cloud Shell Container

If you want to have your shell locally, you can simply use the Multi Cloud Shell Container environment which has all the required tools prepopulated for you.

```shell
cd shell
./build.sh
./start.sh
```

Otherwise use the cloud shells of the provides (beware of the timeouts!) or use you own environment.
