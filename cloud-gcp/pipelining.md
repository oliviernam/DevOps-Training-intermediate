## Prerequisites

- Enable Cloud Build API
- Cloud Build, Google Cloudâ€™s continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform, lets you build software quickly across all languages. Get complete control over defining custom workflows for building, testing, and deploying across multiple environments such as VMs, serverless, Kubernetes, or Firebase.
- Google Container Registry provides secure, private Docker repository storage on Google Cloud Platform. You can use gcloud to push images to your registry , then you can pull images using an HTTP endpoint from any machine, whether it's a Google Compute Engine instance or your own hardware. Learn more

## Create a Workspace

From the Cloud Console, click Activate Cloud Shell `>_`

This virtual machine is loaded with all the development tools you'll need. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs in Google Cloud, greatly enhancing network performance and authentication. Much, if not all, of your work in this codelab can be done with simply a browser or your Chromebook.

Once connected to Cloud Shell, you should see that you are already authenticated and that the project is already set to your project ID.

Run the following command in Cloud Shell to confirm that you are authenticated:

```shell
gcloud auth list
```

Command output:

```
 Credentialed Accounts
ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
*       <my_account>@<my_domain.com>

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

Note: The gcloud command-line tool is the powerful and unified command-line tool in Google Cloud. It comes preinstalled in Cloud Shell. You will notice its support for tab completion. For more information, see gcloud command-line tool overview.

```shell
gcloud config list project
```

Command output

```
[core]
project = <PROJECT_ID>

Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-XXXXX]
```

If it is not, you can set it with this command:

```shell
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
```

## Prepare for GKE Cluster

Set up some variables.

```shell
export PROJECT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
export ZONE=us-central1-b
export CLUSTER=gke-deploy-cluster
```

Store values in gcloud config.

```shell
gcloud config set project $PROJECT
gcloud config set compute/zone $ZONE
```

Run the following commands to see your preset account and project. When you create resources with gcloud, this is where they get stored.

```shell
gcloud config list project
gcloud config list compute/zone
```

Make sure that the following APIs are enabled in the Google Cloud Console:

GKE API
Container Registry API
Cloud Build API
Cloud Source Repositories API

```shell
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
    containerregistry.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    sourcerepo.googleapis.com
```

## Create GKE Cluster

Start your cluster with three nodes.

```shell
gcloud container clusters create ${CLUSTER} \
    --project=${PROJECT} \
    --zone=${ZONE} \
    --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,storage-rw"
```

Give Cloud Build rights to your cluster.

```shell
export PROJECT_NUMBER="$(gcloud projects describe \
    $(gcloud config get-value core/project -q) --format='get(projectNumber)')"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT} \
    --member=serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=roles/container.developer
```

Your environment is ready!
